        A Name is a unique identifier for a component (device, rack, power-supply etc) in an Accelerator Facility. 
        It is divided into several Name Parts (such as System Part, Device Part, and Signal Part). 
        Each Name Part is further divided into Name Elements. For example, the System Part may have System and Sub-system as its elements. 
        The Naming System manages Name Elements. There are several type or categories of Name Elements. 
        Some examples of the Name Elements are: System, Sub-system, Device Type, Signal Type, and Signal Domain.
        
        A name goes through several phases in its life-cycle: 
Inception: When a user requests for a new name
Modification: When user requests for changes to a new name
Retirement:  When a name is removed from the Naming System
A name can be in the following states:
Approved: It is approved for publication. Even though the name has not been published, it can be used.
In Process or Awaiting Approval: A user has requested for a change, and the change is being processed. It is recommended not to use a name which is in this state.
Published: The name is part of the current Naming Standard.
Deleted: The name has been removed from the standard. A name in the state, obviously, must not be used.

Many of the events in the life-cycle occur due to change requests from users.
